## 📋 What You Need First (Important!)

Before using the app, you need **code-server** running:

### Option 1: Install via Termux (Recommended)
1. **Download Termux** from F-Droid:
   - https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/
2. **Open Termux** and run:
   ```bash
   pkg update
   pkg install nodejs
   npm install -g code-server
   ```
3. **Start code-server:**
   ```bash
   code-server --bind-addr 0.0.0.0:8080
   ```
4. **Open Yousef Editor** - It will auto-connect!

### Option 2: Use External Server
- You can connect to any external code-server URL
- Go to Menu → External URL
- Enter your server address (e.g., http://your-server:8080)
